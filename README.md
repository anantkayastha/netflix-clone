# Netflix Clone

This project is a clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix, created using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the main layout and design elements of the Netflix website.

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is designed to be responsive and compatible with various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Similar layout: The layout closely resembles the original Netflix website, with sections for browsing content categories, featured titles, and a responsive navigation bar.
- Custom styling: CSS is used to customize the appearance of elements and achieve a visually appealing design.
- Placeholder content: Placeholder images and text are used to mimic the appearance of actual Netflix content.

## Getting Started
